This is the first post in what is supposed to be the one of the greatest resources for technical information about computers in the 21st cent.... just kidding. 

My main intention for this site is to contain solutions and tips that I discover while facing challenges when using my computer, or when trying to improve my workflow in general. So no specific subject is expected here, I like Python, and I am writing this post on emacs running under BSPWM window manager, more will be revealed in the upcoming posts.
