This is the first post in what is supposed to be the one of the greatest resources for technical information about computers in the 21st cent.... just kidding. 

My main intention for this site is to contain solutions and tips that I discover when faced with challenges while on my computer, or while trying to improve my workflow. So no specific subject is expected here, I like Python, and I am writing this post on emacs running under BSPWM window manager, but don't allow this to make you apply stereotypes to my blog.
